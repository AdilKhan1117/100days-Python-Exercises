**Data Types:**

print("hello"[0]) = H 

print(123 + 345) = 4568



whereas, string is not required

print("123") + ("345") = 123345



**Interger**

#In Python 100,000 should be like this 100_000

print(10_000 + 10_000)



**Floats**

print(1.5 + 1.5) = 3.0



**Boolean: No quotation mark**

True 

False



**Len does not work with integers** 

if your not sure ever what type of data type this is 

you can always do this:  This would identify the type of format the code is in i.e if its a str,int or float.


print(type(num_char))

num_char = len(input("how old are you ? "))

new_numb = str(num_char)


print("what is your name" " " + new_numb )

To comment out lines just do this:

**command button on mac**

**then this backslash /**

**Needed to turn string into interger as remember a string concatenates number and a integer** 



Coding Challenge 1:

  
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡

two_digit_number = input("Type a two digit number: ")

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

####################################

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡


first_number = two_digit_number[0]

second_number = two_digit_number[1]

result = int(first_number) + int(second_number)

print(result)



Coding challenge 2:
**Calculating Maths** 

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡

height = input("enter your height in m: ")

weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

height_new = float(height)

weight_new = int(weight)

bmi_calculate = weight_new / height_new ** 2

print(int(bmi_calculate))


Challenge 3:
  
  
**Rounding numbers:**

print(round(8/3))

print(round(8/3, 2)) to round it off nearest 2 

print(8//3) does the same thing as rounding it off to the nearest number 



**Using this function** 

score = 4/2

score /=2

print(score)



**using string in print, must use the F string to print the score** 

score = 0

print(f"how are you ? + {score}")
