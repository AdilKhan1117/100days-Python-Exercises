Using for Loops. These are used to loops blocks of cpde (repeat)

fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pears"]

for fruits in fruits:
  print(fruits) #This will loop around and print each object inside fruits 
  print(fruits + "pie") #This will loop and add 'pie' to each object, like this 
  
  #apple pie
  #peach pie
  #pears pie
  
  Challenge 1:
  Done use 'sum' or 'len', use only for loop, hoever i will show both being used.
  
  Without For loop:
    
  # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†


#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡


#Sum is used to add all numbers within the object
#Len is also used to add up total length of characters however by using split above, we are only adding individual lines of numbers. 

total_heights = sum(student_heights)
number_of_students = len(student_heights)
average_height = round(total_heights / number_of_students) 
print(average_height)

or this method using 'for loops' 

total_height = 0
for height in student_heights:
  total_height += height
print(total_height) 

number_of_students = 0 
for student in student_heights:
  number_of_students += 1
print(number_of_students)

average_height = round(int(total_height / number_of_students)) 
print(average_height )
#print(number_of_students)


Challenge 2:
  
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
print(student_scores)
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

min_student_score = min(student_scores)
max_student_score = max(student_scores)

print(min_student_score)
print(max_student_score)

the min and max field allows you to understand what is the highest value and lowest. however we are going to be using for loop again for this:
  
Challenger 3:
  
  
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
print(student_scores)
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡


max_value = None 
for num in student_scores:
  if (max_value is None or num > max_value):
    max_value = num
print("Maximum score:", max_value)

or:


#So starting with a 0 score, the 'for loop', runs a loop to indicate the highest score by calculating going through -
#the numbers and checking if the previous score is higher then the recent one until it finds the highest, the high_score only updates if the score looped is greater than
#score

high_score = 0
for score in student_scores:
  if score > high_score:
    high_score = score
print("Maximum score:", high_score)


Loops and Ranges:
  
#This will print out the numbers from 1 to 9
for number in range (1,10):
  print(number)

 #This will skip 3 numbers 
for number in range (1,10, 3):
  print(number)

 #This will add all the numbers up
total = 0
for number in range (1,101):
  total += number
print(total)
